          <div className='sub-title'>The moust essential part of well-ballanced diet is FOOD!</div>
          <div className='details'>
          This means eating a wide variety of foods in the right proportions, and consuming the right amount of food and drink to achieve and maintain a healthy body weight.
          Why a balanced diet? Sometimes we eat because we enjoy the taste and experience of different foods. Sharing food and meals are important social events.
But other than for pleasure, we need food to get nutrients, vitamins, minerals and energy. Very few foods are either all good or all bad. By having an idea of the balance in your diet, it should be easier to enjoy food and be healthy.
There are seven essential factors for a balanced diet: carbs, protein, fat, fibre, vitamins, minerals and water.
